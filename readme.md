## About the Project
As part of a TY program at your local secondary school, a music teacher wants to do a series of music appreciation and life skills classes where the parents of each pupil provide a playlist of their top 10 songs. We will create an application to allow the Music teacher to do this.

### Features:
+ Connection to the database
+ Menu system
+ Mini applications within the application itself:
	- show users
	- show playlists
	- show/play music

### Folders:

* **data** for csv files
* **database** for database files
* **db** for tables and scripts


So, let's start coding!
